# Introduction

Vyse is a general purpose programming language inspired by Lua, and is designed for
embedding in C++ applications such as game engines.

## Design goals.

From the very first day of development, Vyse has been made with specific design goals in mind.

- Familiar to programmers coming from JavaScript or the C-family of languages.
- Minimalistic design
- Powerful and flexible paradigm.
- Light and noise-free syntax.
- Easy to embed in C++ applications and link statically.
- Similar feature set and the easy learning curve of Lua.
